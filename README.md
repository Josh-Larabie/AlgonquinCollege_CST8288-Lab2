AlgonquinCollege_CST8288-Lab2
=============================

This was an assignment from one of my Java college courses (CST8288) where we had to implement the Shannonâ€“Hartley theorem calculation for Maximum data transfer, given a specified amount of noise interference. Credits: Joshua Larabie (Implementation), Algonquin College Staff (UML Design &amp; Specification).

The code found within this project is not intended to allow other students who are taking this college course (CST8288) to cheat, but rather it's purpose is to maintain a record of my projects.
